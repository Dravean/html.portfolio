<h1>The Best Movies According to Darren</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>One Piece is the best anime I've ever watch. The animation is the best.</P>
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>Bleach is the next on my list. <br/>I like the way how they give a character a personality and how it connects to their bankai.</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>Awesome movie. Love cars that's why I love this one.</p>
